# Web-Server-Basic-Auth-Tester

## Overview
Python program dedicated for testing web server with basic auth credentials (root/root)

Information on **requirements**, **usage**, as well as **test cases** can be found in the "Basic Auth Web Server Scanner.pdf" file. This file includes all the previously mentioned information as well as reasoning behind some of the implementation choices I have made which includes using asynchronous requests to save time, choosing between efficiency and coverage, etc.

Please refer to that document before running the code as you will need to install some libraries as well as have a version of Python that is above 3.10 (due to usage of switch-case).
